Here's an example Rust program with a test that you can try out with kcov for code coverage analysis:

1. **Rust Code**: This code snippet includes a simple function and a test for that function.

   ```rust
   // src/lib.rs
   pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
       a + b
   }

   #[cfg(test)]
   mod tests {
       use super::*;

       #[test]
       fn test_add() {
           assert_eq!(add(2, 3), 5);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Running the Tests with kcov**:

   - First, ensure you have kcov installed on your system. You can typically install it via your system package manager.
   - Then, build your Rust tests using `cargo build --release` to generate the binary. For instance, if your project is in the `my_project` directory, you can navigate there and run:
     ```bash
     cargo build --release
     ```
   - Now that your tests are built, you can use kcov to run the tests and collect coverage data.
     ```bash
     kcov --exclude-pattern='/.cargo/' --output-dir=./coverage/ ./coverage/target/release/my_project
     ```
   - This command specifies the output directory for coverage data as `./coverage/` and the target binary to analyze (`./target/release/my_project`).
   - `--exclude-pattern` is used to exclude files or directories from the coverage report (e.g., to exclude Cargo dependencies).
   - You may need to adjust the paths according to your project layout.

3. **Inspecting the Coverage Report**:
   - kcov will generate a coverage report in the specified output directory (`./coverage/`).
   - You can open the HTML report in a web browser to view the coverage data.

You should now have an idea of how to use kcov with your Rust tests to measure code coverage. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
